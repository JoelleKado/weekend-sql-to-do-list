# WEEKEND SQL TO-DO LIST

## Description

_Duration: 15hrs_

My program is a to-do list. Normally, a to-do list must be maintained by a person through personal responsibility: a notebook for example, which must be saved in a drawer or in your pocket. This inherent philosophy of the traditional to-do list lends itself to loss of the to-do list itself. My to-do list lives in a database, its permanent home, and is showcased on the client, an ordinary web-browser, through the server.
